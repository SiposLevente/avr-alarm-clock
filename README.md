# AVR Alarm clock
This project aims to create an alarm clock with the use of an ATmega328P microcontroller.
***
## Planned Features:
* Displays the time on a 4-digit 7-segment display.
* Adjustable time with the use of buttons.
* 9 settable alarms.
* Adjustable brightness. Can be set to automatic brightness control.

## Manual: (WIP)

### Modes:
Cycling between modes happens when the "Mode button" is held down for 2 seconds. When the "Mode button" is pressed for less than 2 seconds the clock displays the currently selected mode's alternative mode.


|Mode#|Default mode        |Alternative mode                  |
|-----|--------------------|----------------------------------|
|0    |Displays time       |Displays the date                 |
|1    |Cycle between alarms|Edit selected alarm               |
|2    |Set brightness     |Enable automatic brightness control|
